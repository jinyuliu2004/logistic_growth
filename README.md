# logistic_growth
**Question 1**
This is an analysis on the logistic growth model for a 100Âµl E.coli isolate cultured in 1ml media, based on growth data recorded in "experiment.csv". 


In the "plot_data.R" file, two graphs are produced to visualize growth rate: 
1. population size (N) against time (t), showing exponential gowth at first, before slowing and reaching equilibrium  
2. log population size (log(N)) against time (t), showing a linear relationship before reaching equilibrium



In the "fit_linea_model.R" file, two linear models are fitted to data from "experiment.csv" under two different scenarios:

Case 1: K >> N0, t is small (exponential growth phase)

Result: ln(N) = 9.990e-03t + 6.903

Case 2: N(t) = K (equilibrium phase)

Result: N = 6.000e+10


**Results**

In the "plot_data_and_model.R" file, the parameters of the model are obtained from the linear models above according to the two regression equations derived from the differential equation of exponential growth:

N(0) = exp(6.903) 

r = 9.990e-03

K = 6.000e+10

The model is plotted with the data points to verify accuracy.



**Question 2**

N(t) = N(0) * exp(r*t)

N(4980) = exp(6.903) * exp(9.990e-03 * 4980)

N(4980) = 4.019501e+24

This is much larger than the carrying capacity and equilibrium population predicted under logistic growth.
